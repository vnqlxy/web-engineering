# Assignment 1: HTML & CSS

You are tasked with building the website for __Artmart__, a web shop for fine art prints.

In this first assignment, you will implement the responsive design of the Artmart website using HTML and CSS. You need to follow the [Artmart Design Guide][design_guide], which you can find on TUWEL.

You should build the website inside the `www` folder. It already contains some HTML and CSS fragments for you to use as starting points, as well as various graphical assets used throughout the site. Take a look at what's there and figure out what remains to be done.

## What you need to do

- Implement the website according to the [Artmart Design Guide][design_guide].
- Write *valid* and *accessible* HTML.
- Pass all the tests (see below).

[design_guide]: https://tuwel.tuwien.ac.at/mod/resource/view.php?id=1091287

## Additional notes

- The design guide may at times be ambiguous or leave some gaps in the specification. You might have to make some judgement calls. Let the tests be your guide. If the tests are at odds with the design guide, the tests are right.

- If you find yourself getting frustrated because you can't seem to get the design *just right*, take a step back and consider the big picture. In order to solve this exercise and pass the tests, it should never be necceassy to push around individual pixels. **Keep it simple.**

- If something is not covered by the tests *but specified in the assignment* (in this case, the design guide), then we expect you to implement it. We might run additional tests on our end. Inversely, if something is not specified in the assignment *but expected by the tests*, then we also expect you to implement it.

- This assignment is about building a static website using **only HTML & CSS**. Do not use JavaScript, which will be covered in the next assignment.

- You are not required to take backwards-compatibility into account. You can code against the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari. You *will* need to ensure cross-browser and cross-platform compatibility, but within reason.

- As this is a group exercise, we expect all team members to contribute in roughly equal amounts. The git history reflects each team member's individual contributions, so keep that in mind.

## Tests

The `test` folder contains automated tests with which you can measure your progress.

> :warning: **Do not modify anything in the `test` folder.** For the final assessment, we will entirely replace this folder with our own (which also might include additional tests). If your code only works with modifications of the test scripts (no matter how trivial!) it will not pass the final tests.

Every time you push a commit to GitHub, the tests will be run automatically on GitHub's servers. To see the results, you have to go to your repository on GitHub and click on the *Actions* tab. There you will see all past test runs. Click on the latest run and look at the *Artifacts* field to download the test report.

If you wish to run the tests locally on your machine, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed. Then you can navigate to the top-level project directory (the one this README is in) and type the following:

    docker run --tty -v "/$PWD":/a1 ipalab/web-eng-a1 node test.js

This will run all the tests and print out your point total. For details, see the generated report at `test/report/report.html`.

> :warning: Please note that due to differences between platforms, it is possible that the results you get locally on your machine differ from those shown on GitHub. **What counts for your grade are the points you see on GitHub.**
